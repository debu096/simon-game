# Simon game

ðŸš€ **Just completed building my own version of the classic Simon game!** ðŸŽ‰

Using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a game where users match a randomly generated sequence of color buttons to level up. Each round, the game sequence grows, testing memory and attention to detail.

âœ¨ **Key Features:**
- Dynamic color sequence generation using JavaScript.
- User interaction through event listeners to track and validate their input.
- Progressive difficulty that adds more complexity as the game advances.
- Clean UI and engaging design using CSS.

ðŸ’¡ Building this project was a great exercise in using JavaScript events, DOM manipulation, and working with logic flows to create interactive applications.

Next up: Adding animations and sounds to make it even more fun! ðŸ”¥
